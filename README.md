Simple photo feed with titles, pictures, description and date for each post

This one was easier to do on my own. 
Still needed to use the help of the tutorial video, however most parts were done correct. 
Tried to simplify CSS file as much as possible;)
Looking forward to next HBA, I think I might start liking it soon...haha =)
